I am auditing [Microsoft Professional Program for Artificial Intelligence track](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/tracks/artificial-intelligence/).

The fourth of 10 courses is [Ethics and Law in Data and Analytics](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT249x+1T2019/courseware/083e1ae3-93c7-1f72-6306-1765a78799e4/9858b654-cac7-48aa-978b-232e1bfe9cd0/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMicrosoft%2BDAT249x%2B1T2019%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40ff699a02-a439-e66f-5e3a-14a6ea2d4238).

# Before You Start

## Data's Ethical Foundations

### Ethics Foundations, Part 2

Ethics is the study of human well-being.

Values about Others
- Reduce Suffering
- Promote Autonomy
- Improve Equality
Values about Myself
- Promote my Virtue/Character
- Want peolpe to Trust me

### Ethical Foundations, Part 3

Data ethics is the study of how data affects human well-being.

## Data's Legal Foundations

### Law, Analytics, and Society

Theme 1: Law is territorial / confined to territory that created it.

Law moves slowly and chases technology.

Theme 2: Strained relationship between law, data analytics, and AI.

There is not much law to regulate how data is collected, shared, and used.

Theme 3: Legal tension with respect to human rights and organizational rights.

### Different Types of Law

Three basic sources of US Law

1. Common Law (judge-made law)
2. Statutory Law
3. Constitutional Law

Common law is created by courts. In the US and former British colonies, judges have the authority to actually create rules of law that determine individual and organizational rights and responsibilities.

An example common law is negligence law. To study it, you research and review court decisions.

Statutory Law is created by representative bodies such as the US Congress. This law is proactively created to regulate individual and organizational behaviour.

An example is GINA passed by Congress to regulate genetic law not discriminating against people.

Constitutional Law comes from the constitution and gives the government the authority to act and restricts that authority to ensure that the branches don't overstep bounds or infringe unnecessarily on rights.

Some laws (like privacy) is sourced in all three kinds of law. Privacy Law can be found in common law in `privacy torts`, in statutory law in legislation like GINA, and in the constitution via amendments.

International law interacts with these sources of US law. E.g., UN Declaration of Human Rights. How they are binding is not the same as US Law, and where they are binding, it's only on the governments that signed, not private organizational parties.

### IRAC Analysis

IRAC: Issue, Rule, Application, and Conclusion

Traditional method for analyzing legal problems that arise in any context.

Interesting case to try IRAC with: 2012 Target knew about a teen's pregnancy before the parents and mailed her ads for baby stuff.

Issue: So what's the Issue or the Legal Problem in the situation? In this case, it might be stated as whether Target infringed on the teenager's rights by using data about her purchasing behavior to identify her as pregnant and then market to her.

Rule: What rules are relevant to the situation? It's an intimate situation, maybe privacy rights violation? Because Target is an organization, versus a part of the gov. subject to constitution, we would start by considering common law privacy torts to see if they are relevant. We may also check for statutes on point to protect her privacy interest.

Application/Conclusion: Unfortunately there were no privacy laws that protected her. Target used internal customer information and externally publicly available data. In applying the facts to the existing rules of privacy there is no breach, so the Conclusion is Target behaved lawfully.

That doesn't mean it was ethical though. Just because you _can_ do it, doesn't mean you _should_ do it.

### IRAC Continued

They give another example of IRAC

## Ethical Data Practice

### Subjective to Objective

He just keeps foreshadowing things that will be brought up in later modules. Name-drops ETL at least.

### A Data Oath

Examples of useful "oaths"

- UN 1985 Declaration for Statisticians
- Certified Analytics Professionals Code of Conduct

Dude's attempt at an oath:

> I as a data practitioner will promote the well-being of others and myself while striving to do no harm with data through:
> 1. Professional application of analytical techniques
> 2. Humility in analytic claims
> 3. Anticipation of legal and regulatory scenarios
> 4. Transparency in computation and documentation
> 5. Fidelity to this oath beyond the bottom line

### Ethical Data Use Cheat Sheet

I like how they worked "Ethical" and "Cheat" into the same sentence.

Anyway it's a screen capture of a page from an article I think, the reference given is:
